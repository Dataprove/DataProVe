DataProVe: A Data Protection Policy and System Architecture Verification Tool

DataProVe is a tool with GUI written in Python that allows a user to specify a high-level data protection (or privacy) policy and a system architecture, then verify the conformance between the specified architecture and the high-level policy. The main goal of the tool is to help a system designer at the higher level (compared to the other tools that mainly focus on the protocol level.), such as policy and architecture design. This step can be important to spot the errors before going ahead with the lower level system specification. 

The verification engine of DataProVe is based on logic, combining both the so-called backward and forward search strategies.
